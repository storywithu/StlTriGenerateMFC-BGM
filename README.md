Actually I DON'T WANT TO OPEN it to public.
IT IS MYSELF IDEA&ALGORITHM~
PLZ DO NOT COPY MY CODE~
## 🧩 Engineering Focus
Structural reliability 
*Focus on long-life infrastructure engineering. Emphasis on maintainability, reliability, and realistic constraints.*
---
## Problem
Implemnet FEA basic algorithm code generation 
---
## Constraints
- Dual projects for CLI ver and Desktop ver.
- CAD geometry modification limited
---
## Approach
- Visual Studio 2022 + C++
---
## Analysis
- Works to analysis tringale base element's weight COG calculation~

## Lessons Learned
- trinagle elements' COG(Center Of Gravity) value calculation is hard~
- Just used for "demo" ver.
